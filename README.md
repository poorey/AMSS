# AMSS-2
# AMSS
# The zip file contains AMSS software. 
# To install the software you would need to clone or download the .zip file to desired directory and unzip the content. 
# The directory is setup so that the iPython notebooks will fir the pretrained model for the desired dataset. 

# There are 4 notebooks available to run 4 models on the dataset located in the ./featurecreature folder
# Aglilent_AMS_version1-HILIC_mi-alldata.ipynb
# Aglilent_AMS_version1-HILIC_plus-alldata.ipynb
# Aglilent_AMS_version1-RP_mi-alldata.ipynb
# Aglilent_AMS_version1-RP_plus-alldata.ipynb 
# for ideal outcomes these notebooks should be run through Jupyter. 

#The new datasets to test the models should replace the test files in ../Data directory of the main AMSS directory

#AMSS_2.7_test.txt  (for methods at 2.7 pH)
#AMSS_9.2_test.txt. (for methods at 9.2 pH)

#the name of the files can be changed in the main Jupyter notebook to customize the input files as needed.
#if you need assistance contact Kunal Poorey (kpoorey@sandia.gov) if needed.
